tsschecker is a powerful tool to check TSS signing status on combinations of various apple devices and firmware versions.

## Features  
* Supports: Apple TV, Apple Watch, HomePod, iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, M1 Macs and the T2 Coprocessor.
* Allows you to get lists of supported apple devices as well as Firmwares and OTA versions for any specified apple device.
* Can check signing status for any firmware version by specifying either a firmware version or a BuildManifest.
* Works without specifying any device relevant values to check signing status, but can be used to save blobs when given an ECID and the option --print-tss-response (although there are better tools to do this).

tsschecker is not only meant to be used to check firmware signing status, but also to explore Apple's TSS servers.<br/>
By using all of its customization possibilities, you might discover a combination of devices and firmware versions that is getting signed but wasn't getting signed before. 

# About nonces:
## recommended generators for saving tickets:
* `0xbd34a880be0b53f3` // default on the Electra, Chimera and Odyssey jailbreak apps.
* `0x1111111111111111` // default on the unc0ver jailbreak app.

## Nonce Entangling (Apple A12/S4 and newer)
Newer devices, such as the iPhone XR or the Apple Watch Series 4 (and any device newer) have nonce-entangling.

this means any boot nonce generated by your device is now also UID derived, and consequently device-specific.<br/>to save usable tickets for a newer device, you need to get the boot nonce that your device actually generates from your generator.

for information on how to get your actual boot nonce, [see this post on r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/cssh8f/tutorial_easiest_way_to_save_blobs_on_a12/).

## Nonce Collisions:

the Nonce Collision method only works on a few firmwares and devices, and is not reliable and not recommended.<br/>it's a lot better to save a ticket with a generator and use the [checkm8](https://github.com/axi0mx/ipwndfu) bootrom exploit or a nonce setter.

Recovery Nonce Collisions only occur on a few iOS versions, like iOS 9.3.3 and iOS 10.1-10.2 on the iPhone 5s<br/>and is not reliable as once you update, your device will almost-certainly not collide nonces anymore.

DFU Nonce Collisions on the other hand, very commonly occur on any device using A7 and A8 chipsets regardless of iOS version and is MUCH more reliable than using recovery collisions.
